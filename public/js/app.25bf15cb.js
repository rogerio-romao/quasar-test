Conceptualizing an architecture that would allow for very complex and inter-dependent state interactions, keeping all the state and UI in sync. I chose Vue and Vuex, a combination i quite like, with the approach to use all of Vuex's capabilities, namely using a module architecture to simplify the state management. There is a large amount of actions and mutations, with a lot of computed properties, watchers and components, with comunication between these being done with props passed down and emitters sending data back up to the parent.",images1:[a(3584),a(2427),a(7800),a(2257)],body:"Styling has been done using Sass with the .sass syntax, taking advantage of the variables, nesting and clean looking syntax, and the layout uses a mixture of CSS Grid and Flex, with responsive media queries to adjust to different sizes. Created a custom icons component for the multiple icons on the UI. There is only a single page view consisting of multi nested components. The complexity is in all the interactions, since almost all modules interact with each other, with a lot of data flows and state changes constantly happening.
