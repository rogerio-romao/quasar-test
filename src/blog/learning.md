### My favorite spots to learn

This will be an informal list and review of the websites / courses I have enjoyed since coming back to coding, in hopes it can be of use to any others out there in the same situation.

There are 2 basic categories, free resources and paid course websites.

##### Free Resources

In no specific order, here are some of my favorites.

**FreeCodeCamp** -
This website features a large amount of guides and courses, from basic HTML to React, Python and many others. They have a built in code editor (not the best one to be honest) where you can do the exercises. And you can optionally donate to the website and get course completion certificates.
[Go to FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

**MDN** -
This Mozilla documentation site is like the bible of web development, and something to be consulted almost daily when working. It's got guides and most of all reference documentation on every Javascript method, HTML element, CSS rule etc.
[Go to MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)

Other alternatives to these two are W3Schools and GeeksForGeeks, but I don't find them as good.
The rest in this category are more of the code challenges / competitive coding category, which are fun but also very instructive and they make you think a lot about problem solving.

**Codewars** -
Pretty cool interface, you can choose from easy problems (called katas on this website), to very hard ones, and you can try to solve them in a wide variety of languages. [Go to Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

**Edabit** -
Very similar to the above, maybe with more beginner friendly challenges. [Go to Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges)

**Exercism** -
Along with the cool name, Exercism has recently had a cool redesign. It used to be a command line tool. You would download the exercises, do them on your own editor, then submit them via CLI. Now you can still do that or you can do them in their integrated editor. The site looks fantastic, there are tons of languages to choose, and it's all test based. So you get all the tests and the prompt, then it's up to you to make them pass. [Go to Exercism](https://exercism.org/)

Honorable mentions go to Codesignal, with Arcade, Challenge and Interview Practice modes, but it seems to not have been updated in a long time; CSS Battle, fun and different - they give you an image that you have to replicate using CSS; Frontend Mentor is a recent discovery, they give you a design for a UI and you have to build it with just the images and design spec; and finally Advent of Code, some mostly hard algorhytmic challenges.

##### Paid Websites

In this category are mostly course sites, many of them pretty well know I would guess, but regardless, here are my favorites. Even if you do not want to spend any money, they are worth checking out, as most will have at least some free content mixed in as well.

**Egghead** -
Egghead has got a quality website and some quality courses. It is a bit pricey ($250 a year at the time of writing). I think their strong point is React courses, although you can find courses on nearly the whole tech stack. [Go to Egghead](https://egghead.io/)

**Pluralsight** -
Another one that is pricey - Premium account Â£370 a year! But the quality is amazing with some unique and exclusive courses and nice features like choosing a carrer track that gives you a recommended course path, or quizzes about a certain subject that give you weak points to work on. [Go to Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/)

**Scrimba** -
Scrimba does have a big selection of free courses mixed in with their paid ones. They are quite unique in that their code editor and video player are integrated, so while watching a video that is showing the code, you can pause the video and interact with the code! It's really quite neat. [Go to Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)

**Vue Mastery & Vue School** -
I am a big fan of Vue and these two websites are the best resources on the web for it, in terms of video courses. Both are equally good in my opinion, obviously there will be some overlap in content, but the styles are pretty different. [Go to Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/) or [Go to Vue School](https://vueschool.io/courses)

I also bought a yearly subscription to Skillshare for the past 2 years, but I no longer will. It's programming content isn't that great, lots of super-beginner type stuff, their interface is starting to feel a bit stale and dated, it seems like they are betting more on lifestyle type courses.
