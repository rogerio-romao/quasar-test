### My favorite spots to learn

This will be an informal list and review of the websites / courses I have enjoyed since coming back to coding, in hopes it can be of use to any others out there in the same situation.

There are 2 basic categories, free resources and paid course websites.

##### Free Resources

In no specific order, here are some of my favorites.

**FreeCodeCamp**
This website features a large amount of guides and courses, from basic HTML to React, Python and many others. They have a built in code editor (not the best one to be honest) where you can do the exercises. And you can optionally donate to the website and get course completion certificates.
[Go to FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)

**MDN**
This Mozilla documentation site is like the bible of web development, and something to be consulted almost daily when working. It's got guides and most of all reference documentation on every Javascript method, HTML element, CSS rule etc.
[Go to MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/)

Other alternatives to these two are W3Schools and GeeksForGeeks, but I don't find them as good.

The rest in this category are more of the code challenges / competitive coding category, which are fun but also very instructive and they make you think a lot about problem solving.

**Codewars**
Pretty cool interface, you can choose from easy problems (called katas on this website), to very hard ones, and you can try to solve them in a wide variety of languages. [Go to Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

**Edabit**
Very similar to the above, maybe with more beginner friendly challenges. [Go to Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenges)

##### Paid Websites
