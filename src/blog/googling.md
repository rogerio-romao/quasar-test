### It is an art

When you start programming, it is hard. There is too much to know. Lots of things that can go wrong. A semicolon can ruin your life.  
So you start Googling around left and right... and you find out that Googling around is also hard. It's hard for several reasons.

It's hard because there is a ton of information out there, much of it inconsistent.  
It's hard because in the beginning you don't know a reputable source from a bad one.  
It's hard because you probably don't really know what is actually wrong with your code. This is probably the biggest hurdle: formulating what your search term is! If you have no idea, it could be any number of things, so you Google like a blind hunter trying to hit a flying duck.

##### With time comes wisdom

What experience and persistence gives you, is an intuition for what is the search term you need to find the answer to your problem. So lately what I found is that more often than not, **what I call the _"magic search"_ consists of a 3 word term**.  
Seems like the more verbose your search is, more unrelated and low quality results will show, whereas when your intuition is more developed, a combination of 3 or so terms will pop into your mind that will deliver ultra specific results.
I don't think this can be tought, you just have to develop it.
