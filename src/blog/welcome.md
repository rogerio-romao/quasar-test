#### Welcome

I have decided it is time for me to finally start a blog.

It is still early days and I am still refining the layout and technicalities of it.

It is a bit unconventional for now with this accordion type layout, but we will see how it goes.

I hope to do some posts about new technologies or lessons learned while coding, and possibly non-programming subjects too, don't know yet, but I have 3 posts roughly outlined in my head.
